Welcome to PunishmentToolKit

I designed this app to be a helpful resource for Penal Departments of polish Regional Courts (and to facilitate my work of course ;-))
Final version will have four modules. Current version is early and holds only one module - that calculates the length of substitutionary punishment. (oblicz karę zastępczą). Modules to calculate punishment execution expiry, calculate fine installments and to calculate social service length when changing its form are to be created in near future. 

You can see currently working module at https://bbombelka.github.io/punishment-tool-kit/. Forms are working pursuant to valid legislation (eg. number of fine stakes ). Module is still in development.
